Note that if connections within a Group result in some subsystems forming a cycle in the graph, then OpenMDAO will not attempt to reorder the cycle.  It will, \n",

    "\n",
    "For auto ordering to be possible, the framework must be able to change the order of a `Group`'s subsystems *after* all of that `Group`'s connections are known.  To make this possible, the setup order of subsystems in a `Group` is converted to alphabetical (instead of order of execution) in order to make the order of OpenMDAO's internal data structures, including the order of variables within `Vectors`, independent of subsystem execution order.  This allows the execution order of subsystems to be changed after connection information is known.  It also has the side benefit of removing previous restrictions on the `Group` `set_order` function that did not allow calling it during the `configure` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of ordering the setup of subsystems alphabetically, some very slight numerical changes may occur in a model due to, for example, rows and/or columns changing order in a jacobian.  In some cases, if a model is very sensitive, this might cause convergence failures or make convergence take \n",
    "longer.  To mitigate this, an option called `allow_post_setup_reorder` has been added to `Problem`.  This option defaults to `True`, but if it is set\n",
    "to `False`, then the setup order of subsystems will *not* be alphabetical, and all `auto_order` options on Groups in that `Problem` will be ignored.\n",
    "Setting the `allow_post_setup_reorder` option is shown below."
