def act_tanh(x, mu=1.0E-2, z=0., a=-1., b=1.):
    """
    Compute a differentiable activation function based on the hyperbolic tangent.

    act_tanh can be used to approximate a step function from `a` to `b`, occurring at x=z.
    Smaller values of parameter `mu` more accurately represent a step function but the
    "sharpness" of the corners in the response may be more difficult for gradient-based
    approaches to resolve.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : float or array
        The input at which the value of the activation function
        is to be computed.
    mu : float
        A shaping parameter which impacts the "abruptness" of
        the activation function. As this value approaches zero
        the response approaches that of a step function.
    z : float
        The value of the independent variable about which the
        activation response is centered.
    a : float
        The initial value that the input asymptotically approaches
        as x approaches negative infinity.
    b : float
        The final value that the input asymptotically approaches
        as x approaches positive infinity.

    Returns
    -------
    float or array
        The value of the activation response at the given input.

    Compute a differentiable maximum between two arrays of the same shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : float or array
        The first value or array of values for comparison.
    y : float or array
        The second value or array of values for comparison.
    mu : float

    -------
    float or array
        For each element in x or y, the greater of the values of x or y at that point.
        This function is smoothed, so near the point where x and y have equal values
        this will be approximate. The accuracy of this approximation can be adjusted
        by changing the mu parameter. Smaller values of mu will lead to more accuracy

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : float or array
        The argument to absolute value.
    mu : float
        A shaping parameter which impacts the tradeoff between the
        smoothness and accuracy of the function. As this value
        approaches zero the response approaches that of the true
        absolute value.

    Returns
