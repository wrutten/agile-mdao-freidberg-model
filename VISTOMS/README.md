VISTOMS is the GUI application developed in the AGILE project (by Imco van Gent and colleagues) to easily create manipulate CMDOWS files.
This approach is not necessary, it should be possible to do this via the command line.

Unfortunately VISTOMS is currently not working due to unknown causes. The python files in this folder are previous attempts to get this working.

It is not clear if VISTOMS will be updated in future, or if a command line example will be developed, as it is currently not clear how the MBSE/MDAO software approach for stellarators will be set up.
