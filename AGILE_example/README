AGILE Example

This folder contains a small example for how to use vistoms to generate new MDAO architectures and store them in an CMDOWS file.
For a detailed explanation you are referred to: https://www.agile-project.eu/open-mdo-suite/#vm, where a full Demonstration video is present.

In short the steps can be summarized as follows:
- Create a data exchange format (KB/EXAMPLE-base.xml). This forms the master parameter hierarchy, of which all other .xml files are derived. It also contains the initial values of the optimization.
- Adapt config.py to match the base.xml file (TODO: there should be a tool to do this automatically somewhere..)
- Create Input/Output .xml files for each tool.
- Wrap your tools in python, such that it conforms to the input/output as defined


I can't seem to reproduce earlier work... VISTOMS is too broken
